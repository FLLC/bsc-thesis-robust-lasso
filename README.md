# bsc-thesis-robust-lasso
This project studies variable selection and prediction in high-dimensional regression with outliers, comparing rowwise (entire rows) vs. cellwise (individual entries) contamination. Lasso-type and robust methods are benchmarked through Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on out-of-sample error and feature selection.
